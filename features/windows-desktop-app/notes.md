# windows-desktop-app — shipped notes

What this feature actually does in the code, and the decisions that are easy to undo by accident.
Moved out of the root `CLAUDE.md` verbatim so it is no longer loaded into every session; the root
indexes it under **Architecture notes**. `spec.md` is what was asked for, `stories/` how it was built,
and this is what shipped.

## Local-disk file storage (Phase 2)

the single `IFileStorage` seam is mode-branched — `LocalDiskFileStorage` (Local, blobs under `FileStorage:BasePath`) vs `MinioFileStorage` (Cloud + hosted). Additive; Cloud unchanged. Since `multi-tenant-cloud` US-5 both compose their keys through the same `ClinicStorageKey` — see that bullet above.

## Connectivity awareness (Phase 3, Local mode)

internet reachability is judged by the **server** (LAN clients may have no egress). `IInternetProbe`/`InternetProbe` (Singleton, cached) backs an anonymous, Local-only `GET /api/connectivity` (404 in Cloud) that the frontend polls via `ConnectivityProvider`/`useConnectivity()`. The one internet-dependent feature — Google Calendar — visibly disables offline and auto re-enables; appointments not yet pushed to Google show a "non synchronisé" badge + manual "Push to Google" (`AppointmentDto.IsSyncedToGoogle`). Cloud gets a static "online" default and behaves as before.

## LAN hosting & security gates (Phase 4, Local mode)

hardens the API for offline-LAN hosting, all additive/gated to Local (Cloud byte-for-byte unchanged). (a) Fail-closed authorization — `AuthorizationPolicies.ConfigurePolicies(options, isLocalMode)` installs a `FallbackPolicy = RequireAuthenticatedUser()` in Local, so anything without an explicit `[AllowAnonymous]` returns 401; the exact allow-list is pinned by `ControllerAuthorizationCoverageTests`. (b) Loopback-only `/hangfire` (`HangfireAuthorizationFilter` + `LocalRequest.IsLoopback`, shared with the `setup` gate / AC-1.2a) — since `cloud-security-and-tenant-isolation` this is loopback-only in **both** modes (Cloud no longer authorizes everyone). (c) Config-driven CORS (`CorsOrigins` — LAN origins via `Cors:AllowedOrigins`), HTTPS cert binding + guarded redirect, and Kestrel bind (`Https:*`/`Hosting:*`) in `Program.cs`. (d) The OAuth callback no longer rewrites appsettings; Google refresh tokens are stored **per-clinic on the `Clinic` entity** (`GoogleRefreshToken`/`GoogleCalendarId`, DB). *(Phase 5 closed the Phase-4 cert-downgrade gap — a set-but-missing `Https:CertPath` now fails startup loud instead of dropping to HTTP. `cloud-security-and-tenant-isolation` then closed the OAuth `state` gap: `connect` mints CSRF `state` into a server cache + HttpOnly double-submit cookie, validated on `callback`; the old singleton `IGoogleTokenStore`/`FileGoogleTokenStore` was retired for per-clinic DB storage.)*

## Packaging, installers & manual backup (Phase 5, Local mode)

turns the app into a self-contained offline-LAN Windows product, all additive/gated to Local (Cloud unchanged). (a) **Same-origin front door** — in Local, Kestrel is the *single* browser-facing HTTPS endpoint: `/api/*` runs in-process and a **YARP** catch-all reverse-proxies every other route (pages, `/_next/*`, `/bff/*`) to the co-located Next server on loopback; the web build ships with relative `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=/api`, so TLS terminates once and no server IP is baked in. Frontend BFF auth routes moved `/api/auth/*` → **`/bff/auth/*`** to avoid colliding with the proxied `/api/*`. (b) **Self-generated HTTPS** — `CertificateProvisioner` mints a CA + SAN server cert into `.local/` on first boot (idempotent); HTTP binds loopback-only, HTTPS (5001) is the only LAN port. (c) **Windows service + startup diagnostics** — `UseWindowsService()` auto-start; `StartupDiagnostics` turns DB-down / port-in-use into clear French messages + non-zero exit (console/log/Event Log). (d) **One-click backup** — admin-only `POST /api/backup` → `PgDumpBackupService` (`pg_dump` custom-format dump + file-storage copy to a timestamped folder; fails loud, never a silent partial). (e) **`LocalInstallPaths`** anchors `.local/`, `Files/`, `logs/` to the install dir (a service's CWD is `System32`). (f) **`desktop/`** WebView2 shell + **`packaging/`** publish script and Inno Setup server/client installers (bundled PostgreSQL 16, Node, NSSM, CA-trust import) — **operator-verified (R-1)**, not CI-runnable.
